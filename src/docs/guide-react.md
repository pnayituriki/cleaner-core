# ⚛️ React Integration Guide (Upcoming)

Future releases of `@cleaner/core` will include a `useCleaner()` hook for:

- Normalizing form state
- Validating on change or blur
- Integrating with i18n/localized errors
- Plug-and-play with react-hook-form or Formik

```ts
const { data, errors, normalize } = useCleaner(config);
```

🚧 *Planned for v1.1 release*
